# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles to be used with GNU Stow.

## Quickstart
1. `git clone https://github.com/aaron-miller/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`  # Must be here.
2. Make sure GNU Stow is installed.  # `sudo apt-get install stow`/`sudo dnf install stow`
3. `stow <dir>` # dir being the directory with dotfiles you want to link to $HOME
4. ls -la $HOME # voila!
